# Comments and Critiques
---
## Overall
- ... 001: the color scheme is appealing.
- ... 002: a printable match to the main blue is elusive.
## Spool Holder
- ... 011: is too free-wheeling.
- ... 012: was broken and not fixable in one delivery (couldn't find an adhesive).
- ... 013: sticks out an an odd angle.
- ... 014: is on the same side as the USB port (GOOD).
## Power Inlet
- ... 021: seems upside down (1 us down while 0 is up).
- ... 022: causes cord to stick straight out thus requiring a 90&deg; adapter.
- ... 023: should be on the same side as the spool holder and interface ports to minimize protrusions.
## Klipper Screen
- ... 031: is partially eclipsed by the printed case for sight and touch.
## Electronics Compartment
- ... 041: mcu_fan is full on and noisy.
- ... 042: is protected with a formed sheet (GOOD).
## Toolhead
- ... 051: is large and obscures view of nozzle interface to buildplate.
- ... 052: fan is noisy.
## Filament Path
- ... 061: requires disassembling PTFE tube when filmament runs out (distance from sensor to toolhead is long so loading a follower is not reasonable).
