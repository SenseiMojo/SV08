# Comments and Critiques
A check in the box indicates there is at least one solution for the issue (or it isn't an issue if it's a bullet).

## Overall
- 001: the blue/anthracite color scheme is quite appealing (or at least not appalling).  The grey Comgrow version is actually nicer from a utilitarian point of view.
- [x] 002: a printable match to the main blue is elusive thus mods must be printed in a complementary color.  Similar for the grey - but that's less of an issue.
- [x] 003: the frame may be a bit wobbly.
- [x] 004: the printer may vibrate and move around a bit as well as shake the table.
- [x] 005: the stock printer cannot print ABS/ASA/etc.
- [x] 006: the stock system can only print one color.
- [x] 007: sometimes it is tough to align the build plate.
## Camera
- [x] 071: is mounted at a shallow angle not giving optimal view of the plate from its location.
## Electronics
- [x] 041: mcu_fan is (by default) always full on and it is noisy.
- 042: bay in base is protected with a formed sheet (GOOD).
- [x] 043: main board does not use mainline Klipper.
- [x] 044: USB stick failed on at least one machine within a month.
## Filament
- [ ] 061: path requires disassembling PTFE tube when filmament runs out (distance from sensor to toolhead is long so loading a follower is not reasonable).
- [x] 062: doesn't seem to flow through the nozzle consistently.
- [x] 063: can get tangled in stock spool holder ruining a print.
- [x] 064: is dumped in many places (front left, back left) - there is no trash can.
- [x] 065: sensor (apparently) randomly generates an error on Stepper Z1.  Unplugging it avoids the error but not having a filament sensor is archaic (barbaric?).
- [x] 066: runs out and the printer doesn't stop.
## Interface
- [ ] 021: for power inlet seems upside down - 1 is down while 0 is up.
- [x] 022: for power inlet causes cord to stick straight out thus unnecessarily distancing printer from the wall.
- [ ] 023: for power inlet should be on the same side as the spool holder and interface ports to minimize protrusions.
## Screen
- [ ] 031: (Klipper) is partially eclipsed by the printed case for sight and touch.
- [ ] 032: (Klipper) requires 2 separate cables that run externally.
- [x] 033: (Standard) is a bit klunky although functional.
- [ ] 034: (Standard) menu options are bare bones.
## Spool Holder
- [x] 011: is too free-wheeling.
- [x] 012: was broken and not fixable in one delivery - couldn't find a suitable adhesive.
- [x] 013: sticks out an an odd angle and is unnecessarily above the top surface.
- 014: is on the same side as the USB port (GOOD).
- [x] 015: sticks out far to the side because its diameter is at right angles to the side of the printer.
- [x] 016: only holds one spool
## Toolhead
- [ ] 051: is large and obscures view of nozzle interface to buildplate.
- [ ] 052: fan is noisy.
- [x] 053: board does not use mainline Klipper.
- [ ] 054: doesn't actually dip low enough to clean the nozzle on the brush.
- [ ] 055: intentially sets nozzle onto plate and squishes out filament before printing purge line which seems like a bad idea.  But maybe this is intentional to minimize nozzle oozing and help clean it?
- [ ] 056: is missing spring on tensioner screw.  In general, of the ~12 toolheads delivered, about half had missing parts.

# Builds
A check in the box indicates this mod has been applied to the indicated unit.

## Unit1- FALCONER
Why FALCONER?  It is a translation of "sovol". Although the origin of SOVOL (as a company name) is not known, the world "sovol" translates to "owl" (Ukrainian/Czech) or "question" (Uzbek) but somewhere it was also mapped to "falconer" (link lost).  The owl is an obvious choice - especially given Sovol's alignment with Obico and their logo.  But, "falconer" is more in line with the Voron nomenclature.

## Unit2- HYDRA
Why HYDRA?  Say "ee-dra" (Ã©dra)...  Besides a wonderful destination in Greece, Hydra also alludes to a multi-headed monster which sounds like a good name for a toolchanger.  Thank Michael at [Teaching Tech](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7roEGbkvSCc&list=PLGqRUdq5ULsNIN_40Bv1iTbElj6O7BRrU) for this.

## Unit3- STRIX
- Why STRIX?  See FALCONER and the obvious link to owl.  This unit is actually labeled Comgrow and has grey parts (instead of the Sovol SV08 light blue).  STRIX is a genus of owls including S. nebulosa (but nebulosa doesn't sound as cool).  [Wikipedia Great Grey Owl](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_grey_owl).

## Unit4- NACHTEULE
- Why NACHTEULE?  A trip to the German consulate while deliberating on this Comgrow unit may have influenced the choice of name as the coloring suggests night owl.

# Notes to Self
Ideas when modding a Voron or Delta (or any printer or related device)

## Note: Consolidate Protrusions
- Where possible, conslidate protrusions to keep distancing restrictions to a single side.
  - It's okay if they aren't grouped together (separate physical from high-voltage ports from low-voltage ports).
