# Comments and Critiques
---
## Spool Holder
- ... is too free-wheeling.
- ... was broken and not fixable in one delivery (couldn't find an adhesive).
- ... sticks out an an odd angle.
- ... is on the same side as the USB port (GOOD).
## Power Inlet
- ... seems upside down (1 us down while 0 is up).
- ... causes cord to stick straight out thus requiring a 90&deg; adapter.
- ... should be on the same side as the spool holder and interface ports to minimize protrusions.
## Klipper Screen
- ... is partially eclipsed by the printed case for sight and touch.
## MCU Fan
- ... is full on and noisy.
## Extra_MCU fan
- ... is noisy.
## Filament Path
- ... requires disassembling PTFE tube when filmament runs out (distance from sensor to toolhead is long so loading a follower is not reasonable).
